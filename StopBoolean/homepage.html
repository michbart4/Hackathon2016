Bullying can take on many forms, but all forms of bullying can be very hurtful.
A bully can physically, mentally, or emotionally hurt you, through mean words 
or harsh actions, but nowadays, the worst kinds of bullying happens when you can’t 
even see the bully in person. Cyberbullying happens from behind a screen, when a bully
uses a cell phone, computer, or tablet to send unkind text messages or social media comments.
A bully may even use pictures, videos, or fake profiles to embarrass someone.

Here are some tips to deal with a cyberbully:
<ul>
<li>Know that it’s not your fault,</li>
<li>Save the evidence by screenshotting or screen capturing the negative comments.</li>
<li>Reach out for help.</li>
<li>Protect your accounts.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Some great comeback lines are:
<ul>
<li>Whatever!</li>
<li>Do you feel better now?</li>
<li>If you're talking about me behind my back, clearly my life is a lot more interesting than yours is!</li>
<li>Let’s move on!</li>
<li>You finally found something funny to say?</li>
<li>I’m not sure why you keep saying these things about me, but I don’t care.</li>
<li>Be really cool and stop this!</li>
<li>Enough!</li>
<li>Why are you talking to me?</li>
<li>Here we go again.</li>
<li>I've been called worse from better.</li>
<li>Wow, did you come up with that all by yourself?</li>
<li>Pardon me, but you seem to think that I care.</li>
</ul>

Play the game to see if you can go up against a bully.
